# If the USB drive was plugged into the vehicle before you attempted to connect   #
# the vehicle to a Wi-Fi network, a list of available Wi-Fi networks will be      #
# automatically displayed below. Uncomment the one that you want to connect to by #
# removing the pound sign.                                                        #

# If you have validated the Wi-Fi credentials but the Wi-Fi LED doesn't           #
# turn solid blue, try restarting the vehicle by pressing the reset button.       #
# When the power LED turns blue, plug the USB drive in again.                     #
